# NeatMarkDown
Markdown editor that supports MathJax math styling.

Inspired by annoyingly redundent code and math styling with Latex in college assignments. We're not writing a book, we just want more sleep.

Developed with [NW.js](nwjs.io), [node-pandoc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-pandoc), [codemirror](codemirror.net) and Macbook. 

```
$$
e^{\pi i} - 1 = 0
$$
```
will look like

$$
e^{\pi i} - 1 = 0
$$
