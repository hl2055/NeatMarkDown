# NeatMarkDown
Markdown editor that supports MathJax math styling.

Inspired by annoyingly redundent code and math styling with Latex in college assignments. We're not writing a book, we just want more sleep.

Developed with [NW.js](http://nwjs.io), [node-pandoc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-pandoc), [codemirror](http://codemirror.net) and Macbook. 

You'll also need [pandoc](http://pandoc.org) and [Latex](https://www.latex-project.org/) to make it work.

Please consult [http://docs.nwjs.io/en/latest/](http://docs.nwjs.io/en/latest/) for how to run nwjs applet.
